@title{Joining lenses to view lists}

@defproc[(lens-join/list [lens lens?] ...) lens?]{
  Constructs a lens that combines the view of each
  @racket[lens] into a list of views. This lens can
  be used to view and set a list of values in a single
  target. If any of the lenses share views, then when
  setting the later lenses override the earlier ones.
